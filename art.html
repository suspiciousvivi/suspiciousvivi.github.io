        Here you will find some of my art I've done in the past, from 2021 to 2024. Many of these drawings were made using various programs, such as FireAlpaca, Krita and Clip Studio PAINT, of which I'm currently using the latter. 
        As for the tablet itself, I'm using a Wacom Intuos BT S, of which I for as a gift for Christmas in 2020. I'm not the greatest artist ever, but I've gotten an artstyle for myself of which people can recognize me. For most of my drawings, are posted in Twitter, Tumblr and Pixiv.<br>Here you will see some of my recent drawings.<br>
