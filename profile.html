             Oh hey. My name's <strong>Vivi</strong>. I'm the creator and webmaster of this site. 
             You may known me in various sites as SuspiciousVivi! I'm an non binary and bisexual adult from Costa Rica (<strike>saquenme de aquí</strike>) and I speak Spanish and English, with a little bit of acknowledge of Japanese and French. 
             I have autism spectrum disorder (better known as autism) and also I'm a bit introvert in real life, so if you get to know me, I'm a little bit complicated to talk with you. 
             I'm also an artist which draws very frequently. 
             I'm at level B2 of English, so my English is very of high accurancy.<br>
             When I first entered social media, I was using Youtube, Facebook and Fandom, then I first created my original Twitter account, and then I've created many other social media accounts, mostly Discord and Tumblr. 
             I'm a high school gradulate, and I won't probably be studying for college because of mental health problems.<br>
             Aside from video games, I'm also good at drawing (either traditional or digital), and also others. My likings can vary over time.
