    Oh hey. My name's <strong>Vivi</strong>. I'm the creator and webmaster of this site. 
    You may known me in various sites as SuspiciousVivi! I'm an non binary and bisexual adult from Costa Rica (<strike>saquenme de aquí</strike>) and I speak Spanish and English, with a little bit of acknowledge of Japanese and French. 
    I have autism spectrum disorder (better known as autism) and also I'm a bit introvert in real life, so if you get to know me, I'm a little bit complicated to talk with you. 
    I'm also an artist which draws very frequently, you can check some of my art in the Art Gallery section of my site. 
    I'm at level B2 of English, so my English is very of high accurancy.<br>
    When I first entered social media, I was using Youtube, Facebook and Fandom (my heatred), then I first created my original Twitter account, and then I've created many other social media accounts, mostly Discord and Tumblr. 
    I'm currently at the last grade of high school, and I won't probably be studying for college because of mental health problems.<br>
    Aside from video games, I'm also good at drawing (either traditional or digital), and also others. My likings can vary over time.
